# live system for uart/rs485/modbus hacking and troubleshooting
# I use a 13 year old laptop as a dedicated serial debugging tool

# GOAL: from boot to work in < 5 sec
# GOAL: internet and shared folders supoort
# GOAL: use to debug my dc inverter's status display (no documentaion at all)
# GOAL: debug solar charge controller (came with a modbus usb adapter that requires rs485 mode in linux)
# GOAL: debug dc20d mkii generator controller (has good documents, but does not seem to follow work out of the box, needed to use thier software)
# GOAL: debug usr-w610 operation and configurations (works good for sniffing data from uart/modbus transmissons)
        originally i would just wire another slave onto the bus, but that does not distinguish from rx or tx, it is just a continuous data stream
        i found that i can easily use 2 usr-w610 devices to sniff just the rx or just the tx data streams by simply swapping the server/client placement.
        this sped up decoding the inverters status display data stream alot for me.
