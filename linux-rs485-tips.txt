# some rs485 usb adapters need to have rs485 mode enabled. You can do this in minicom's serial port settings.
# normally when you exit minicom it will reset the connection, disabling rs485 mode. if you want it stay on to use with another program
# exit minicom WITHOUT reseting the connection use "Quit without Reset" or Ctrl-Z, Q
