# some rs485 usb adapters need to have rs485 mode enabled. You can do this in minicom's serial port settings.
# normally when you exit minicom it will reset the connection, disabling rs485 mode. if you want rs485 mode to stay on so you 
# can use with another program just exit minicom WITHOUT resetting the connection using "Quit without Reset" or Ctrl-Z, Q.
